### Task 1 - 
The task involves setting up a GitHub repository named samsung-riscv, installing the RISC-V toolchain, and performing hands-on exercises based on provided lab videos. The goal of this task is to familiarize participants with the RISC-V architecture, its toolchain, and the workflow for executing C-based and RISC-V-based programs.

The steps include:

- Watching reference videos to understand program flow.
- Installing the RISC-V toolchain using the provided VDI link.
- Following the lab exercises and executing them on a local system.
- Capturing dated snapshots of the implementation and uploading them to the GitHub repository.

### Task 2 -
The task focuses on SPIKE Simulation, compiler optimizations, and analyzing RISC-V object dumps. The objective is to understand how compiler optimization levels affect the generated machine code and execution performance.

The key steps include:

- Reviewing the SPIKE Simulation video to understand the workflow.
- Running simulation experiments with -O1 and -Ofast compiler optimization flags.
- Writing a simple C program as a test case.
- Compiling the program using RISC-V GCC/SPIKE with different optimization levels.
- Generating and analyzing the RISC-V object dumps for both -O1 and -Ofast.
- Uploading snapshots of the compiled code and object dumps to the GitHub repository.
  
### Task 3 -
The objective of this task is to deepen the understanding of RISC-V instruction formats by analyzing and decoding instructions from an application code's riscv-objdump output.

The key steps include:

- Reviewing the RISC-V software documentation to understand the R, I, S, B, U, and J instruction formats.
- Exploring a sample GitHub repository to visually comprehend RISC-V instruction decoding.
- Extracting 15 unique RISC-V instructions from the riscv-objdump of the application code.
- Identifying the 32-bit binary representation of each instruction based on its format.
- Uploading the instruction patterns to the GitHub repository.

  ### Task 4 -
The objective of this task is to perform a functional simulation of a given RISC-V Core Verilog netlist using a testbench. This process helps in verifying the functional correctness of the core by analyzing output signals and waveforms.

The key steps include:

- Downloading the necessary files, including the Verilog netlist and testbench for the RISC-V Core.
- Setting up the simulation environment using tools like Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and GTKWave.
- Running the functional simulation, ensuring that the core executes correctly.
- Observing and verifying the output signals to check the correctness of execution.
- Capturing and saving waveform snapshots to analyze the core's behavior.
- Uploading simulation results (waveforms, output logs, and descriptions) to the GitHub repository.

  ### Task 5 -
The objective of this task is to update the GitHub repository with well-structured documentation, ensuring clarity in presenting the project details. This step enhances the readability and usability of the project for future reference.

The key steps include:

- Updating the repository with the project name and a brief overview of the application.
- Listing all required components needed to build the application.
Creating clear visuals, including:
-A Pinout Diagram designed in PowerPoint to replace any existing hand-drawn sketches.
- A Circuit Connection illustration for better understanding.
- Providing detailed pin connections, including:
- A structured table describing the wiring and pin mappings.

  ### Task 6 -
This task marks the final stage of the program, where we must submit the final working code and demonstrate the application in action to showcase the implementation of RISC-V technology.

The key steps include:

- Uploading the final working code to the GitHub repository.
- Recording a short video demonstration showcasing the application's functionality.
- Submitting the video as part of the final deliverables.

The ultimate goal of this task is to ensure that all participants successfully complete their projects and effectively demonstrate their practical application of RISC-V technology.
