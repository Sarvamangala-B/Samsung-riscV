Objective:
To perform a functional simulation of a RISC-V Core using the provided Verilog netlist and testbench.

Steps to Complete the Task:

1.create a directory:
By using mkdir file_name create a file.
Then by using touch netlist_file.v command create a verilog file to download the given verilog netlist. Similarly create a testbench file to download the test bench code.

2.Download Files:
Obtain the Verilog netlist from the given resource (RISC-V Core Verilog Netlist).
Download the testbench from the specified resource (Testbench for RISC-V Core).

3.Set Up Simulation Environment:
Ensure you have a simulation tool installed, such as iverilog (for simulation) and gtkwave (for waveform visualization).
Load the Verilog netlist and testbench into the chosen simulation tool.

4.Run Functional Simulation:
Simulate the RISC-V Core using the testbench.
Observe and verify the core's output signals for functional correctness.

5.Capture Waveforms:
Generate waveform files for the simulated design (e.g., .vcd files).
Use tools like gtkwave to capture and save waveform snapshots corresponding to the executed instructions or signals.
